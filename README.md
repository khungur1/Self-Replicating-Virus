# CuBFF

CUDA-accelerated simulation of self-modifying program soups that exhibit emergent self-replication.

Based on the paper [**"Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19108).

## What It Does

CuBFF evolves populations of 64-byte programs that interact in pairs — one program executes using the other as memory, then they swap roles. Over thousands of epochs, natural selection-like dynamics emerge: programs that can copy themselves into their partner persist, and self-replicators spontaneously arise from random initial conditions. The simulation tracks Brotli compression ratio as a proxy for structural order and Shannon entropy to measure emergent complexity.

## Quick Start

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libbrotli-dev    # dependencies
make                                               # CUDA build (or: make CUDA=0)
bin/main --lang bff_noheads                        # run simulation
bin/main --lang bff_noheads --eval_selfrep         # with self-replication detection
```

## Realtime Visualizer

Build with Python bindings, then launch the server:

```bash
make CUDA=0 PYTHON=1
pip install numpy websockets
python3 python/realtime_server.py --lang bff_noheads --eval_selfrep
```

Open `http://localhost:8766/realtime-visualizer.html` in your browser. The server runs the simulation and streams state over WebSocket (port 8765) to the dashboard.

Server flags: `--lang`, `--seed`, `--num`, `--port` (WebSocket, HTTP is port+1), `--eval_selfrep`, `--callback_interval`, `--max_visible`, `--max_epochs`.

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Soup Heatmap** | Programs x byte positions, colored by language-defined byte colors. Green border = self-replicator. |
| **Kymograph** | Time-series stacked over 512 epochs showing mean byte, dominant byte, or rep score per program. |
| **Spectrogram** | Byte value (0-255) frequency distribution over time. Shows which bytes are selected for/against. |
| **Entropy Map** | Per-position Shannon entropy over time. Low entropy = structured/meaningful positions. |
| **Rep Score** | Soup heatmap modulated by self-replication score (dim=none, red=partial, green=confirmed). |
| **Metrics Chart** | Multi-line graph tracking phase transition indicators: Brotli BPB (drops when structure emerges), H0 (Shannon entropy), higher-order entropy, and replicator count (spikes when self-replicators appear). |
| **Byte Frequency** | Most and least common bytes in the current population. |
| **Inspector** | Click any program to see its 64 bytes with hex codes and colors. |

The phase transition is visible when Brotli compression drops, entropy stabilizes, and self-replicators suddenly appear — the kymograph and spectrogram panels show this as the soup goes from random noise to structured, self-replicating programs.

### Other Visualizations

- **1D/2D frame output** — `bin/main --draw_to <dir>` and `--draw_to_2d <dir>` write PPM image sequences of the soup state each epoch
- **BFF trace visualizer** (`python/bff-visualizer.html`) — step-by-step execution debugger for individual BFF programs
- **Python analysis scripts** — `python/time_to_sr.py` (time-to-self-replication statistics), `python/selfrep_spawning.py` (spawn rate analysis), `python/cond_prob.py` / `python/cond_exp.py` (conditional entropy analysis)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Shared memory tapes** — Program tapes loaded into CUDA shared memory for fast interpreter access
- **Warp-level reductions** — Entropy and statistics computed with warp shuffle intrinsics
- **Async CUDA streams** — Overlapped kernel execution and host-device transfers
- **Background compression** — Brotli compression runs in a separate CPU thread
- **CPU+GPU hybrid** — Configurable fraction of work offloaded to CPU via OpenMP (`--cpu_fraction`)
- **Feistel permutation** — O(1) per-thread deterministic shuffle with no host-to-device transfer (`--fixed_shuffle`)
- **CheckSelfRep early-exit** — Programs that diverge early skip remaining iterations
- **Sampling** — Check only a percentage of programs for self-replication (`--selfrep_sample_pct`)

## Python Bindings

Build with pybind11 support:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pybind11
make CUDA=0 PYTHON=1
```

Example usage:

```python
from bin import cubff

language = cubff.GetLanguage("bff_noheads")

def callback(state):
    print(state.epoch, state.brotli_bpb)
    return state.epoch > 1024

params = cubff.SimulationParams()
params.num_programs = 131072
language.RunSimulation(params, None, callback)
```

See `python/cubff_example.py` for a complete example.

## Testing

Run a single language against reference output:

```bash

```

CI tests all languages. To regenerate test data:

```bash
